Made using p5js over the span of a few days.

![Tetris](./TetriDemo.png)

Made mostly for my own entertainment, expect nothing good

## Todo:
- [x] Drawing blocks and grid
- [x] Movement
- [x] Basic rotation
- [x] Points and clearing lines
- [x] Proper tetris spawning
- [x] INTERMISSION: UI Sprucing up with html(Meh good enough 4 now)
- [x] Pause
- [x] More intermission: Demo screen for github swag
- [x] Lose condition and basic warning
- [ ] Next box
- [ ] Hold functionality
- [ ] Smarter rotation
- [ ] Win/lose screens

I might not implement any of the above, or i might refactor this list entirely
