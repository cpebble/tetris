# A Tetris clone
Made using p5js in a few hours.

Made mostly for my own entertainment, expect nothing good

## Todo:
- [x] Drawing blocks and grid
- [x] Movement
- [x] Basic rotation
- [ ] Points and clearing lines
- [ ] Smarter rotation
- [ ] Win/lose screens
- [ ] Next box
- [ ] Hold functionality

I might not implement any of the above, or i might refactor this list entirely
