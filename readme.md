# A Tetris clone
Made using p5js in a few hours.

Made mostly for my own entertainment, expect nothing good

## Todo:
- [x] Drawing blocks and grid
- [x] Movement
- [x] Basic rotation
- [x] Points and clearing lines
- [x] Proper tetris spawning
- [ ] INTERMISSION: UI Sprucing up with html
- [ ] Next box
- [ ] Hold functionality
- [ ] Pause
- [ ] Smarter rotation
- [ ] Win/lose screens

I might not implement any of the above, or i might refactor this list entirely
